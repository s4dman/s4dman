### Hi there 👋
I build mobile apps with Android and Kotlin, and I have an ongoing love affair with Django. I spend an unhealthy amount of time turning messy ideas into clean UI/UX - think digital spring-cleaning, but with more caffeine.
- 🌱 Currently diving deeper into Android internals, where features evolve faster than you can say ‘deprecated’.
- 😄 Fun fact: Errors don’t scare me, they flirt with me.
- 👯 Always open to teaming up on Android or Django projects. Bonus points - if there’s a chance to tame a particularly stubborn bug.
```kotlin
object Sadman {
 val name = "Sadman Hasan"
 val education = "Master of Applied Computing"
 val institute = "University of Windsor"
 val skillSet = listOf("Kotlin", "Java", "Python", "Django", "HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript")

 val website = "sadmanhasan.com"
 val contact = "sadman.h@live.com"
}
```
